Getting Started
===============

Adding TrustKit to an App can be achieved through the following steps:

1. Generating SSL pins for the App's server endpoints and choosing a pinning
policy.
2. Adding TrustKit as a dependency to the App's Xcode project.
3. Initializing TrustKit with the pinning policy.


Warning
-------

Public key pinning can be dangerous and requires more than just code-level
changes in your App. If you make a mistake, you might cause your App to pin a
set of keys that validates today but which stops validating a week or a year
from now, if something changes. In that case, your App will no longer be able to
connect to its servers and will most likely stop working, until it gets updated
with a new set of pins.

Unless you are confident that you understand the Web PKI that you can manage
the App servers' cryptographic identity very well, you should not use key
pinning.


Generating SSL Pins
-------------------

Before deploying SSL pinning within your App, you first need to investigate and
choose which domains and public keys need to be pinned. This is **very
important** as enabling the wrong pinning policy may prevent your App from being
able to connect to its servers, when the servers' keys are rotated.

The following blog post provides some information on which keys to pin and what
the trade-offs are:
[https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/](https://noncombatant.org/2015/05/01/about-http-public-key-pinning/).

In the context of TrustKit, an SSL pin is the base64-encoded SHA-256 of a
certificate's Subject Public Key Info; this is the same as what is described in
the [HTTP Public Key Pinning
specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Public_Key_Pinning).

To generate such values, three bash scripts are available. The first two scripts
can be used to generate the pin configuration from a PEM or DER certificate:

    $ ./get_pin_from_pem_certificate.sh ca.pem
    $ ./get_pin_from_der_certificate.sh ca.der

The second script can be used to generate the pin configuration for the highest
certificate within the certificate chain returned by a given server:

    $ ./get_pin_from_server.sh www.google.com


Deploying TrustKit
------------------

Enabling TrustKit within an App requires generating a pinning policy and then
initializing TrustKit with this policy. There are two different ways to supply
a pinning policy to TrustKit:

* Programmatically, using TrustKit's `initializeWithConfig:` method.
* By storing the pinning policy in the App's _Info.plist_; this approach allows 
deploying TrustKit without having to modify the App's source code.

After initialization, TrustKit will by default perform method swizzling on the 
App's `NSURLSession` and `NSURLConnection` delegates in order to perform additional 
validation against the server's certificate chain, based on the configured SSL pinning 
policy. 

If the developer wants a tighter control on the App's networking behavior or does
not want auto-swizzling, it can be disabled by setting `kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates` to `NO`.
Manual pinning validation can then be implemented in the App's authentication handlers' using the 
[TSKPinningValidator class](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/documentation/Classes/TSKPinningValidator.html).


### Adding TrustKit as a Dependency - CocoaPods

The easiest way to deploy TrustKit in an App is via CocoaPods. To do so, add the 
following line to your Podfile:

    pod 'TrustKit'

Then run:

    $ pod install

If CocoaPods cannot be used, TrustKit can be added to an Xcode project manually;
instructions on how to do so are available at the end of this guide.


### Configuring a Pinning Policy

There are two ways to supply a pinning policy to TrustKit:

* By adding configuration keys to the App's _Info.plist_ file under a 
`TSKConfiguration` dictionary key:

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking3_dynamic.png)

* Programmatically, by calling the `initializeWithConfiguration:` method with your 
pinning policy.

A pinning policy is a dictionary of domain names and pinning configuration keys.
At a minimum, the configuration should specify a list of SSL pins and the
corresponding certificates' public key algorithms. For example:

    #import <TrustKit/TrustKit.h>

    NSDictionary *trustKitConfig =
    @{
      // Auto-swizzle NSURLSession and NSURLConnection delegates to add pinning validation
      kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates: @YES,
      
      // The list of domains we want to pin and their configuration
      kTSKPinnedDomains: @{
              
              @"yahoo.com" : @{
                      // Pin all subdomains of yahoo.com
                      kTSKIncludeSubdomains:@YES,
                      
                      // Do not block connections if pinning validation failed so the App doesn't break
                      kTSKEnforcePinning:@YES,
                    
                      // Send reports for pin validation failures so we can track them
                      kTSKReportUris: @[@"https://trustkit-reports-server.appspot.com/log_report"],
                      
                      // The pinned public keys' algorithms
                      kTSKPublicKeyAlgorithms : @[kTSKAlgorithmRsa4096],
                      
                      // The pinned public keys' Subject Public Key Info hashes
                      kTSKPublicKeyHashes : @[
                              @"TQEtdMbmwFgYUifM4LDF+xgEtd0z69mPGmkp014d6ZY=",
                              @"rFjc3wG7lTZe43zeYTvPq8k4xdDEutCmIhI5dn4oCeE=",
                              ],
                      },
              
              @"www.datatheorem.com" : @{
                      // Block connections if pinning validation failed
                      kTSKEnforcePinning:@YES,
                      
                      kTSKPublicKeyAlgorithms : @[kTSKAlgorithmRsa2048],
                      
                      kTSKPublicKeyHashes : @[
                              @"HXXQgxueCIU5TTLHob/bPbwcKOKw6DkfsTWYHbxbqTY=",
                              @"0SDf3cRToyZJaMsoS17oF72VMavLxj/N7WBNasNuiR8="
                              ]
                      }}};

To avoid locking out too many users from your App when deploying SSL pinning
for the first time, it is advisable to set `kTSKEnforcePinning` to `NO`, so that SSL 
connections will succeed regardless of pin validation. 

Also, adding a report URL using the `kTSKReportUris` setting to receive pin validation failure 
reports will help track these failures. You can use your own report server or Data Theorem 
(info@datatheorem.com) provides a dashboard to display these reports for free.

This will give you an idea of how many users would be blocked, if pin validation was to be enforced.

The list of all the configuration keys is available in the
[documentation](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/documentation/Classes/TrustKit.html).

After supplying the pinning policy, and if `kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates` is set to `YES`, all of 
the App's `NSURLConnection` and `NSURLSession` delegates will automatically enforce the policy.


Manual Pin Validation
---------------------

In specific scenarios, TrustKit cannot intercept outgoing SSL connections and automatically 
validate the server's identity against the pinning policy. For these connections, the pin validation 
must be manually triggered: the server's trust object, which contains its certificate chain, needs to 
be retrieved or built before being passed to the 
[`TSKPinningValidator` class](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/documentation/Classes/TSKPinningValidator.html) 
for validation. 
 
`TSKPinningValidator` returns a `TSKTrustDecision` which describes whether the SSL connection 
should be allowed or blocked, based on the App's SSL pinning policy.
 
 The following connections require manual pin validation:
 
 1. All connections within an App that disables TrustKit's network delegate swizzling by setting the `kTSKSwizzleNetworkDelegates` configuration key to `NO`.
 2. Connections that do not rely on the `NSURLConnection` or `NSURLSession` APIs:
     * Connections leveraging different network APIs (such as `NSStream`). Instructions on how to retrieve the server's trust object are available in the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/NetworkingTopics/Articles/OverridingSSLChainValidationCorrectly.html).
     * Connections initiated using a third-party SSL library such as OpenSSL. The server's trust object needs to be built using the received certificate chain.
 3. Connections happening within an external process:
     * `WKWebView` connections: the server's trust object can be retrieved and validated within the `webView:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:completionHandler:` method.
     * `NSURLSession` connections using the background transfer service: the server's trust object can be retrieved and validated within the `application:handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:completionHandler:` method.


Pinning in WebViews
-------------------

Adding SSL pinning to connections initiated within a `UIWebView` is difficult as the class does not
provide direct APIs to handle authentication challenges. As mentionned in 
[Apple's technical note about HTTPS trust evaluation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2232/_index.html), 
customizing certificate validation in a `UIWebView` can still be achieved using `NSURLProtocol` to intercept all outgoing
connections. However, implemeting this technique is a complex and significant engineering effort. 

Overall, the best approach to implementing SSL pinning in webviews seems to be by migrating to
the `WKWebView` class introduced in iOS 8, which provides 
[delegate methods](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/WebKit/Reference/WKNavigationDelegate_Ref/) to handle authentication challenges (such as server SSL certificate 
validation). However, this approach still requires some testing as it seems like the 
`webView:didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge:completionHandler:` delegate method [only works reliably on iOS 9](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135327).


Other Ways to Embed TrustKit
----------------------------

### Adding TrustKit as a Dependency - Static Linking

If CocoaPods can't be used and for Apps targeting iOS 7, TrustKit can be statically 
linked.

1. Drag and drop the TrustKit Xcode project file in your project:

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking1.png)

2. Within the "General" tab for your App's target, add _libTrustKit_Static.a_ to
the "Linked Framework and Binaries" section:

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking2_static.png)

3. Within the "Build Settings", add TrustKit's folder to the "User Header Search
Paths" setting and set "Always Search Header Paths" to "Yes":

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking3_static.png)

4. Add `-ObjC` to the to the "Other Linker Flags" parameter within the App's Build 
Settings.

5. Lastly, initialize TrustKit with your pinning policy.


### Adding TrustKit as a Dependency - Dynamic Linking

If CocoaPods can't be used and for Apps targeting iOS 8+ or OS X, TrustKit can be 
dynamically linked.

1. Drag and drop the TrustKit Xcode project file in your project:

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking1.png)

2. Within the "General" tab for your App's target, add TrustKit to the
"Embedded Binaries" section:

    ![](https://datatheorem.github.io/TrustKit/images/linking2_dynamic.png)

3. Lastly, initialize TrustKit with your pinning policy.
